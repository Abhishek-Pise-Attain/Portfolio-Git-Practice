# Portfolio project #

This repository was forked from Github user: "manish1610" and the repository's link is: "https://github.com/manish1610/portfolio".

It was forked for me to practice 'Version Control' using 'Git'. Here's the things that I did:

1. Created a Github account.
2. Forked a repository.
3. Cloned a repository from the Github account to my local desktop.
4. Made a branch and messed around with the project.
5. Merged the branch back into the main branch also called as master.
6. Resolved any merge conflicts.
7. Push the local repository.
8. Learned how important is to know VCS and the power of Git.
